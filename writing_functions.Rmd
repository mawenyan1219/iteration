## Z-scores!!

compute the z-score version of a list of numbers

```{r}
x_vec = rnorm(25, mean = 7, sd = 4)

(x_vec - mean(x_vec)) / sd(x_vec)
```


suppose you want this often
```{r}
z_scores = function(x) {
  z = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
  z
                        }

z_scores(x_vec)

z_scores(x = 1:10)

z_scores(x = rbinom(100, 1, 0.6))

z_scores(x = 3)
```

update z-scores

```{r}
z_scores = function(x) {
  
  if (!is.numeric(x)) {
    stop("Argument x should be numeric")
  } else if (length(x) == 1) {
    stop("Z scores cannot be computed for length 1 vectors")
  }
  
  z = mean(x) / sd(x)
  
  z
}
```
